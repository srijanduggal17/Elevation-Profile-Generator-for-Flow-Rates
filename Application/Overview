The purpose of this application is to allow users to retrieve and visualize elevation data in 3d.
It is composed of two sections: the data retrieval, and the visualization.
The data retrieval is in a desktop application run using electron and the visualization is in MATLAB.

In order to execute it, run the desktop application and then input the region you would like data for.
Then exit out of the desktop application and open MATLAB to run the script.

There are two main HTML files: index.html and query.html
index.html is the page which prompts you to enter the latitudes and longitudes for your region.
query.html is the page which queries the Maps API each time it refreshes until it retrieves the data for all the requested points.
Once the files are saved, run visualizationScript.m in MATLAB.
