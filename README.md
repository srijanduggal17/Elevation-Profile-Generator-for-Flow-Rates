# Elevation-Profile-Generator-for-Flow-Rates
The goal of this project is to create a tool that helps people create elevation profiles and calculate flow rates for any region of the world.

I started this for the Uganda Project for Engineers without Borders at Georgia Tech. We were trying to figure out where to place a tapstand in a certain region of the country but we needed a certain flow rate output.
