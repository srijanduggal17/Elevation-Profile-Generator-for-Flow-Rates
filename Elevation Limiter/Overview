This code was written in JavaScript. 
It uses node's file system because I wanted to save a JSON file locally as well as fast-csv to write CSV files.
The main code is in "sketch.js".
The input points are "elevationdata.JSON"
The output points are "prelimtapoptions.JSON" and "prelimtapoptions.csv".
Then I opened the csv file, saved it in Excel, and sorted the elevations from low to high
