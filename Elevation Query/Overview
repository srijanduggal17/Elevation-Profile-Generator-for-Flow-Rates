This code was written in JavaScript. It uses electron.js (a framework for desktop development) because I wanted to save a JSON file locally.
"package.JSON" and "main.js" are general files for the electron framework.
"index.html" just links to the JS file because electron hosts an html file on your desktop.
The main code is in "sketch.js".
The input points are "pointstotest.JSON"
The output points with elevation data are in "/Results".
There are 21 files because the query speed was significantly quicker with datasets of this size.
