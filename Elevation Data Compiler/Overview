This code was written in JavaScript. It uses electron.js (a framework for desktop development) because I wanted to save a JSON file locally.
"package.JSON" and "main.js" are general files for the electron framework.
"index.html" just links to the JS file because electron hosts an html file on your desktop.
The main code is in "sketch.js".
The input files are the 21 files "rawdatawithelevationX.JSON"
The output file with all latitude-longitudes paired with elevation data are "elevationdata.JSON"
