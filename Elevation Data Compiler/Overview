This code was written in JavaScript. It uses node's file system because I wanted to save a JSON file locally.
The main code is in "sketch.js".
The input files are the 21 files "rawdatawithelevationX.JSON"
The output file with all latitude-longitudes paired with elevation data are "elevationdata.JSON"
